	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>
		In a world where boundaries are blurred, and voices are stifled, {config.branding.name} emerges as
		a sanctuary of hope—a place where the spirit of freedom on the internet refuses to be quelled. Our
		story is one of passion, heart, and an unyielding desire to safeguard the very essence of the internet—the
		boundless realm where dreams are born and ideas soar.
	</p>
    
	<p>
		At {config.branding.name}, we cherish the memory of the internet's inception—an era when
		visionaries painted a canvas of limitless possibilities, where connectivity knew no bounds, and
		where knowledge flowed like an endless river. It was a time when freedom was the guiding light,
		illuminating the path towards progress and understanding.
	</p>

	<p>
		Yet, as time passed, shadows began to cast their pallor upon the online landscape. The free and
		open internet we once knew started to fade, giving way to censorship, oppression, and control.
		The very essence of what the internet was meant to be seemed to wither away, and we couldn't
		bear to watch this transformation without action.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our hearts ached for a world where the exchange of ideas was unrestricted, where access to
		information was a birthright, and where the collective voice of humanity resonated freely. We
		knew that we had to stand tall, to protect the spirit of liberty that had ignited the hearts of
		millions.
	</p>

	<p>
		With unwavering determination, we embarked on a journey—a journey to champion internet freedom
		and restore the glory of the digital realm. The road was arduous, but the hope in our hearts
		fueled our perseverance. We envisioned a place where barriers would crumble, where dreams could
		be shared across oceans, and where empathy and understanding would bridge the gaps that divided
		us.
	</p>

	<p>
		The foundation of {config.branding.name} was laid on the pillars of privacy, anonymity, and trust.
		We vowed never to compromise on our commitment to safeguarding your personal freedom. Your privacy
		is not a commodity to be traded; it is a sacred right, and we stand as guardians, shielding you from
		prying eyes and ensuring your voice remains your own.
	</p>

	<p>
		As we built {config.branding.name} with love and dedication, we were overwhelmed by the incredible
		support of individuals who believed in the power of a free internet. They came from all walks of
		life, each with their unique stories to share—a poet seeking inspiration, an artist searching for
		her muse, a student yearning for knowledge, and a dissident longing to be heard.
	</p>

	<p>
		Their stories etched upon our hearts, driving us to strive for excellence in our service. With
		every barrier we helped break, with every rekindled flame of hope in someone's eyes, we found
		our purpose reaffirmed. Our hearts swelled with joy each time we received messages of gratitude
		from those whose voices we had aided in setting free.
	</p>

	<p>
		And so, dear friends, we invite you to join us on this emotional journey—a journey of hope and
		liberation. Together, let us cherish the internet's soul, nurturing its spirit of freedom so
		that it may thrive for generations to come. Let us create a world where the exchange of ideas
		knows no restrictions, and where the internet remains a beacon of unity and enlightenment.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the face of adversity, let us stand strong, united by our shared love for the boundless
		possibilities of the digital realm. With {config.branding.name} as our guiding light, we shall forge
		ahead, knowing that in preserving internet freedom, we are preserving the very essence of humanity.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thank you for being part of our heartfelt mission. Together, we will make a difference and
		continue to believe in the power of freedom.
	</p>

	<p>With love and boundless hope,</p>
