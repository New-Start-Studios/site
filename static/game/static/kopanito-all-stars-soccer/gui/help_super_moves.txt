<p>In the upper part of the screen there are two skill bars, that fill up during play. One bar is for your team and the other one is for opponents. When it fills up, youâ€™ll receive a random super-move and a glowing icon will appear.</p>
<p>To activate a super-move, press <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="powerup">E</span>. Sometimes itâ€™s required to hold that button longer, depending on the super-move.</p>
<p>Some super-moves can be used to counteract opponent super-moves.</p>
