<h3>Sprinting</h3>
<p>Hold <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="sprint">Shift</span> to sprint. This works only on players without the ball. Players donâ€™t have stamina and never get fatigued, so sprinting is unlimited.</p>

<h3>Pushing forward</h3>

<p>You can push the ball forward by quickly tapping <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="pass">S</span>. This works only if there is no team member in front of your player. Then you can catch up the ball by sprinting.</p>

<p>When changing players with <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="togglePlayer">S</span>, itâ€™s important to indicate the direction from the player youâ€™re looking at to the ball using
        <span class="grid middle">
            <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="up"></span>
            <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="down"></span>
            <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="left"></span>
            <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="right"></span>
        </span>.
    If you have left stick centered or no arrow keys pressed, then the game will select the closest player to the ball.</p>

<h3>Other tips</h3>

<p>Player with the ball is slower and canâ€™t sprint. If the opponent will run into the ball when youâ€™re dribbling, then he will steal it from you. Also if youâ€™ll stop moving, youâ€™ll lose the ball, as it will roll away from your player. Of course the player with the ball can be knocked down by a precise sliding tackle, so being fast and precise is important to maintain control of the ball. If you have a problem with dribbling, then consider making more passes, as the moving ball is usually faster than any opponent.</p>
