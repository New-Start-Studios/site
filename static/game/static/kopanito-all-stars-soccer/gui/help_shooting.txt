<h3>Direct shot</h3>

        <p>Press quickly <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="shoot">D</span></p>

<p>By quickly pressing <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="shoot">D</span>, your player will make a sort of an automatic shot in the best direction according to him. The kick wonâ€™t be strong, this type of shot is best used if you manage to lure an opponentâ€™s goalkeeper out of his goal. If you hold the shoot button a little longer (but not too long to not enter precise shot mode), a kick will be a little stronger.</p>

<h3>Chip shot</h3>

        <p>Press quickly <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="shoot">D</span> just before receiving a pass</p>

<p>This type of shot is much stronger than a direct shot, but still kick direction is automatic. It can be performed during a pass or lob. The receiving player will kick the ball in an opponentâ€™s goal just after trapping the ball. You need to press the shot button shortly before that.</p>

<h3>Precise shot</h3>

<p>By holding the shoot button, youâ€™ll enter precise shooting mode, where you can adjust kick direction using
    <span class="grid middle">
        <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="up"></span>
        <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="down"></span>
        <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="left"></span>
        <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="right"></span>
    </span>
    and apply ballâ€™s swerving. The longer you hold the button, the stronger the shot will be.</p>

        <p>Hold <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="swerveUp">W</span> or <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="swerveDown">S</span></p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The dashed targeting line can be bend by holding <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="swerveUp">W</span> or <span class="key auto-wide auto-update" data-action="swerveDown">S</span> to making the ball swerve. This is a good way to mislead the opponentâ€™s goalkeeper or to shoot from very narrow angles.</p>
<p>Note: a strong shot may knock down other players, including a goalkeeper.</p>
